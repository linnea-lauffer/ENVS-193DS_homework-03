# Problem 1. Personal Data

## a. 

I could calculate the mean total hours of sleep for both work nights and non-work nights to compare how my sleep duration varies. This is informative, as I expect that on work nights I may sleep less as I have a night time job and have classes in the late morning, and comparing the average sleep time helps me evaluate how my work schedule affects my rest. 

## b. 

```{r}
my_data_clean <- my_data |> # starting data frame
  clean_names() # clean column names

sleep_summary <- my_data_clean |> # start with cleaned data
  mutate(work_night = as.factor(work_night)) |> # convert work_night column to a factor (categorical variable)
  group_by(work_night) |> # group the data by work_night
  summarise(mean_sleep = mean(total_sleep_hours)) # calculate mean of total_sleep_hours for each group

ggplot(data = my_data_clean, # starting data frame
       aes(x = work_night, # x axis as type of night
           y = total_sleep_hours)) + # y axis as total sleep hours 
  stat_summary(fun = mean, # show bar representing the mean
                geom = "bar",
                fill = "plum",
                width = 0.6) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = "black", size = 1.5) + # show individual data points
  labs(x = "Work Night", y = "Total Sleep (hours)",
       title = "Comparison of Total Sleep Between Work and Non-Work Nights") + # relabel axes
  theme_minimal() # apply a clean theme 
```

## c. 

**Figure 1: Average total sleep hours by work night status.** Bars represent the mean total sleep duration (in hours) on work nights and non-work nights. Individual data points are shown as jittered black dots to illustrate the distribution of sleep duration. 

## d. 
```{r}
sleep_summary |> # starting data frame
  mutate(mean_sleep = round(mean_sleep, 1)) |>  # round to 1 decimal place
  gt() |> # create a gt table
  cols_label( # rename the columns
    work_night = "Work Night", # change 'work_night' to 'Work Night'
    mean_sleep = "Mean Total Sleep (hours)" # change 'mean_sleep' to 'Mean Total Sleep (hours)'
  ) |>
  tab_header( # add a title to the top of the table
    title = "Mean Total Sleep Hours by Work Night Status"
  )
```

# Problem 2. Affective Visualization

## a. 

The affective visualization for my data would look like a forest, with each night of sleep represented by a tree. The height of each tree would show how many hours I sleep, and the tree's color would reflect the noise level that night. Red dots or "berries" on each tree would represent the caffeine intake. Dashed lines in the trunk would indicate it was a work night, representing rough bark. The trees would be arranged in date order to form a landscape that visually represents my sleep over time.

## d. 

"Sleep Forest" is a visual metaphor that transforms my nightly sleep data into a living ecosystem of trees. Each tree represents one night of sleep, with its height corresponding to total sleep duration, leaf color reflecting noise levels (green for quiet, yellow for moderate), caffeine consumption appearing as small red berries (each berry equal to one ounce of caffeine), and work nights are portrayed with rough, textured bark, while non-work nights have smooth, calm outlines. This pieces is inspired by the natural storytelling of the Dear Data project and the emotional, science-based artwork of Jill Pelto. I created the visualization digitally using an iPad, focusing on a natural tree shape and fine textural details. My process involved mapping sleep metrics to symbolic visual elements, sketching out tree designs, and then rendering each one. The final work invited viewers to experience sleep as something dynamic and alive, a forest that breathes and changes with each day. 

# Problem 3. Statistical Critique

## a.

The authors use a generalized linear model to investigate the ecological and anthropogenic factors that influence the intensity of elephant crop damage on individual farms in the Selous-Niassa Wildlife Corridor. The response variable is the proportion of a farm damaged by elephants, and the predictor variables include: distance to water bodies, proportion of preferred crops, percent open and closed woodland in 1 km^2 around the farm, percent of nearby settlements/farms in 1 km^2 around the farm, and percent refuge in 1 km^2 around each farm. This model allows the authors to identify which landscape or land-use variables are significantly associated with the severity of elephant damage.
